# Coronavirus Stats
A small thing I made to experiment with web-scraping.

After running, in the data folder there will be a data.csv file with all the stats available @ this moment _(each file has a timestamp)_.

### Release 3.1 will include a built in executable
###### And maybe the web-page... still working on that

# Data gathered from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

# Dependencies:
* [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) 
* [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

# Run:
python /src/main.py _-gui_ **or** _-no_gui_

#### -gui will open a window where you can then run CStats
#### -no_gui will run CStats in the console

# Support the cause:
* [Hand-made vizors for romanian doctors, made and distributed for free](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

* [Donate within the daruieste viata campaign](https://www.daruiesteviata.ro/campanii/sprijinim-lupta-cu-covid-19/bG3DOJ2da)

* And of course, do your part and #stayathome #staiacasa
